# physicsSim

Hey everyone!👋🏽 This project is one of many of my APCSA final projects that I decided to work on.

This code is to simulate physics (as the name of the repo implies), using principles of conservation of energy and momentum.
I have coded it with Java, which allowed me to learn more about the AWT library and implement OOP as well as physics concepts learned in AP Physics 1.

Please, try out the project and test out the different objects and different physics scenarios.

Thanks!
